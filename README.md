<!-- Living README Summary -->
## 🌳 Living Summary

This folder contains files related to a software project. It includes controllers for handling billing and subscriptions, a main file for a Flask app with routes, modules for candidate matching, data analytics, candidate tracking, and task automation, a model for user accounts, a service for user authentication, and a Python program that implements a simple Snake game using the Pygame library.


### `Controllers`

This folder contains three files. 
"Billing.py" defines a method for calculating monthly charges. 
"Subscription.py" contains a class for handling subscription upgrades, including authentication. 
"login.py" provides a template for implementing a login functionality.


### `MetaGPT_(Prompt_Advisers).ipynb`

✏️ The file `main.py` is the main entry point of the program and contains the Flask app and routes for handling HTTP requests. It calls other modules to perform specific tasks.
✏️ The file `candidate_matching.py` implements the `CandidateMatching` class, which uses spaCy to calculate the similarity between a candidate and a job description.
✏️ The file `dashboard.py` defines the `Dashboard` class, which generates a data analytics dashboard using Plotly.
✏️ The file `candidate_tracking.py` contains the `CandidateTracking` class, which manages candidate data using SQLite3.
✏️ The file `task_automation.py` implements the `TaskAutomation` class, which automates tasks using Celery.
✏️ The `display_md_files` function in the last code cell displays the contents of Markdown files in a specified directory.
✏️ The `display_md_files` function is intended to provide a cleaner display of the results, showing the content of Markdown files in a more readable format.
✏️ The function iterates through folders and displays the name of each Markdown file, followed by its content in Markdown format.
✏️ The function is useful for quickly reviewing the contents of Markdown files and understanding the structure and information they contain.
✏️ The function is designed to be flexible and can be used with any directory containing Markdown files.


### `Models`

This folder contains a single file called "account.py" which defines a class called "Account". The class has a login method for authenticating users, a static method to upgrade user accounts, and another static method to get the tier of a user. The login, upgrade, and getTier methods require implementation.


### `Services`

This folder contains a file named Auth.py, located under the Services folder. The purpose of this file is to handle user authentication. It contains a class named Auth with a static method named user, which takes two parameters: authMethod and token. The user method returns an integer based on the authentication method: 1 for Google, 2 for Facebook, 3 for Twitter, and 0 for any other authentication method.


### `snake_game.py`

🐍 This file is a Python program that implements a simple Snake game using the Pygame library. 
🕹️ The game allows the player to control a snake on a window and eat food to grow longer while avoiding collisions with the borders of the window and its own body. 
🎮 The game features include drawing the snake and food on the window, keeping track of the score, displaying a "Game Over" message when the game ends, and handling keyboard input to control the snake's direction. 
🚀 The game is implemented using functions that handle different aspects of the game, such as drawing the snake and food, generating random coordinates for the food, updating the score, and checking for game over conditions. 
📝 The main game loop continuously updates the snake's position based on the player's input, checks for collisions and food consumption, updates the snake's body, and redraws the game objects on the window. 
🔢 The game maintains the score and length of the snake, and the player can restart the game after it ends. 
🌈 The file also includes comments that improve the readability and explain the purpose of each code block. 
💡 This file can be used as a starting point for learning Pygame or as a basis for developing a more complex Snake game. 
🔧 To run the game, Pygame library needs to be installed and the code can be executed in a Python environment.
